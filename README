# ðŸ”¢ Exploring Java Enums

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project is a simple Java exercise designed to **understand and explore the `enum` class** and its key methods such as `ordinal()`, `compareTo()`, and `values()`.

It demonstrates how enumerations work internally in Java, how to define them, and how to use their built-in methods for comparing and iterating over constant values.

## ðŸ§© Key Concepts

### ðŸ”¹ What is an Enum?
An `enum` (short for *enumeration*) is a special Java type used to define a **fixed set of constants** â€” for example, days of the week, levels of difficulty, or directions.

Example:
```java
enum Niveau {
    DEBUTANT, INTERMEDIAIRE, AVANCE;
}
