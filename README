# 🟢 Java Enum Exploration — Days & Civilite

## 📘 Overview
A simple Java project exploring **enumerations (`enum`)** and their main features.  
Focuses on creating enums with attributes, constructors, and methods, while practicing **`ordinal()`**, **`compareTo()`**, and understanding the difference between static instances and real enum types.

---

## 🧩 Content
- **Enum `Days`** → represents days of the week with numeric & name fields.  
- **Class `Civilite`** → static instances (`mme`, `mr`, `mlle`) to compare with enum behavior.  
- **Class `Test`** → demonstrates usage of `ordinal()`, `compareTo()`, getters, and enum iteration.

---

## ⚙️ Key Concepts
- Enum fields, constructors, and methods.  
- Static vs enum-based constants.  
- `ordinal()` → position of enum constant.  
- `compareTo()` → compares enum order.  
- Basics of `EnumSet` & `EnumMap`.
